# All At Home (Aah!)

In Italy, during the covid lockdown, a common problem is to find food shops offering delivery service or pick-up points. Supermarkets and big operators are often stuck. Small local shops are working, but some of them are struggling for the increased demand.

The goal of this project is to make easier for people to find and buy from local places that offer home delivery and/or pick-up points. In this way queues and, as a consequence, human contacts can be more easily avoided.

This project has also a broader view. In these days, we learned that work from home and local shopping are possible. We would like to built a solid platform to allow people to buy local even after the epidemic is over.
